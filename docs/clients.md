# Sending alerts

**Disclaimer**: Prometheus automatically takes care of sending alerts
generated by its configured [alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/). It is highly recommended
to configure alerting rules in Prometheus based on time series data rather than
implementing a direct client.

**API v1 has been removed** from Alertmanager as of version 0.27.0. You should
use API v2 instead. The scheme for API v2 is specified as an OpenAPI specification
and can be found [here](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager/blob/master/api/v2/openapi.yaml).

Clients are expected to continuously re-send alerts as long as they are still
active (usually on the order of 30 seconds to 3 minutes).

The labels of each alert are used to identify identical instances of an alert
and to perform deduplication. The annotations are always set to those received
most recently and are not identifying an alert.

Both `startsAt` and `endsAt` timestamp are optional. If `startsAt` is omitted,
the current time is assigned by the Alertmanager. `endsAt` is only set if the
end time of an alert is known. Otherwise, it will be set to a configurable
timeout period from the time since the alert was last received.

The `generatorURL` field is a unique back-link which identifies the causing
entity of this alert in the client.
