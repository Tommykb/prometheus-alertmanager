- Unmarshalling is weird. Alertmanager has a status page that just marshalls config into a string. When I tried to use my library with it, it blew up because the timeinterval library hides many of its internal fields and thus they can't be marshalled.
  I worked around this by creating a 'config.TimeInterval' concept. Real timeintervals can be created from this representation by re-unmarshalling maybe?
