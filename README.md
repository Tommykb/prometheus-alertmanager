# Alertmanager

Prometheus Alertmanager - **still experimental!**

Alertmanager receives alerts generated by Prometheus and takes care of the
following aspects:

* manual silencing of specific alerts
* inhibiting alerts based on alert dependencies
* aggregating alerts by labelset
* handling notification repeats
* sending alert notifications via external services (currently email,
[PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com/) or
[Pushover](https://www.pushover.net/) or 
[HipChat] (https://www.hipchat.com/))

See [config/fixtures/sample.conf.input](config/fixtures/sample.conf.input) for
an example config. The full configuration schema including a documentation for
all possible options can be found in
[config/config.proto](config/config.proto). Alertmanager automatically reloads
the configuration when it changes, so restarts are not required for
configuration updates.

## Building and running

    make
    ./alertmanager -logtostderr -config.file=/path/to/alertmanager.conf

## Configuring Prometheus to send alerts

To make Prometheus send alerts to your Alertmanager, set the `alertmanager.url`
command-line flag on the server:

    ./prometheus -alertmanager.url=http://<alertmanager-host>:<port> <...other flags...>

Prometheus only pushes firing alerts to Alertmanager. Alertmanager expects to
receive regular pushes of firing alerts from Prometheus. Alerts which are not
refreshed for a period of `-alerts.min-refresh-period` (5 minutes by
default) are expired.

Alertmanager only shows alerts which are currently firing and pushed to
Alertmanager.

## Running tests

    make test

## Caveats and roadmap

Alertmanager is still in an experimental state. Some of the known caveats which
are going to be addressed in the future:

* Alertmanager is run as a single instance and does not provide high
  availability yet. We plan on clustering multiple replicated Alertmanager
  instances to ensure reliability in the future.
* Relatedly, silence information is currently only persisted locally in a file
  and lost if you lose the machine your Alertmanager is running on.
* Alert aggregation needs to become more flexible. Currently alerts are
  aggregated based on their full labelsets. In the future, we want to allow
  grouping alerts based on a subset thereof (for example, grouping all alerts
  with one alert name and from the same job together).
* For alert dependencies, we want to support time delays: if alert A inhibits
  alert B due to a dependency and B begins firing before A, wait for a
  configurable amount of time for A to start firing as well before sending
  notifications for B. This is not yet supported.
* Alertmanager has not been tested or optimized for high alert loads yet.
